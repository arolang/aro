# Disclaimer

## AI-Generated Project

**The ARO Programming Language was fully implemented with artificial intelligence.**

This entire project—including the parser, compiler, runtime, documentation, website, CI/CD pipeline, and this disclaimer—was created through collaboration between a human and [Claude](https://claude.ai), an AI assistant developed by Anthropic.

## What This Means

### Code
- All Swift source code was generated by Claude
- The lexer, parser, semantic analyzer, and runtime were AI-written
- All 27 language proposals were drafted by AI
- Test suites were AI-generated

### Documentation
- Language guides, tutorials, and API references
- The website (HTML/CSS)
- This README and all markdown files

### Infrastructure
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines
- Dockerfile and deployment scripts
- Build system configuration

## Human Contribution

A human provided:
- High-level direction and requirements
- Design decisions and feedback
- Review and iteration guidance
- The vision for a feature-driven, AI-friendly programming language

## Why Disclose This?

We believe in transparency about AI's role in software development. ARO itself is designed to be AI-friendly—a language where the gap between human intent and machine execution is minimal. It's fitting that ARO was built by AI.

This project demonstrates:
1. AI can build complete, working programming languages
2. Human-AI collaboration produces functional software
3. The line between "human-written" and "AI-written" code is blurring

## Quality & Correctness

While AI-generated, the code has been:
- Compiled and tested (262 passing tests)
- Iteratively refined through feedback
- Designed following established patterns

However, AI-generated code may contain:
- Subtle bugs not caught by tests
- Suboptimal implementations
- Inconsistencies across the codebase

Use at your own discretion. Contributions and bug reports are welcome.

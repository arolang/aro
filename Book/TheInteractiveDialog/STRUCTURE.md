# ARO: The Interactive Dialog

## Structure

This book provides a focused introduction to the ARO REPL—a conversational interface for exploring, prototyping, and learning ARO interactively.

*"The best way to understand a language is to speak it."*

### Philosophy

The Interactive Dialog is intentionally short. You don't read about conversations—you have them. This book gets you into the REPL quickly and shows you just enough to begin your own exploration.

**Total: ~22 pages** — A book you can read in one sitting.

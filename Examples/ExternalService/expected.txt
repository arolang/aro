ARORuntime/RuntimeContext.swift:122: Fatal error: Runtime Error: Cannot rebind immutable variable 'response'
Feature: Application-Start
Business Activity: External Service Demo

Variables in ARO are immutable. Once bound, they cannot be changed.
Create a new variable instead: <Action> the <response-updated> ...

This error indicates the semantic analyzer missed a duplicate binding.
Please report this as a compiler bug.

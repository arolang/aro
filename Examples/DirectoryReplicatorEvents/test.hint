# Test hints for DirectoryReplicatorEvents
# DirectoryReplicatorEvents uses local ./template directory (self-contained)
# Must run from within example directory for consistent path resolution
workdir: Examples/DirectoryReplicatorEvents
# Fixed: Binary mode works with self-contained template directory
mode: both
# File operations don't work correctly on Windows CI
skip-on-windows: File operations not supported on Windows CI

# Clean up directories from previous test run
pre-script: rm -rf foo baz

# Verify directories were created (exit 0 = pass, non-zero = fail)
# Test by side effects instead of output comparison (observers run concurrently)
test-script: test -d foo && test -d foo/bar && test -d baz

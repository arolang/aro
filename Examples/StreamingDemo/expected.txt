=== ARO Streaming Execution Demo ===

1. Wrote events to events.jsonl (JSON Lines format)
JSONL is ideal for streaming: each line is independently parseable

2. Read events.jsonl:
level: INFO
message: Request received
service: api
time: 45
timestamp: __TIMESTAMP__

level: ERROR
message: Database timeout
service: api
time: 5000
timestamp: __TIMESTAMP__

level: WARN
message: Rate limit exceeded
service: auth
time: 120
timestamp: __TIMESTAMP__

level: INFO
message: Request completed
service: api
time: 89
timestamp: __TIMESTAMP__

level: ERROR
message: Authentication failed
service: auth
time: 15
timestamp: __TIMESTAMP__

level: INFO
message: Cache hit
service: api
time: 5
timestamp: __TIMESTAMP__

level: ERROR
message: Connection refused
service: api
time: 3000
timestamp: __TIMESTAMP__

level: DEBUG
message: Task started
service: worker
time: 0
timestamp: __TIMESTAMP__

level: INFO
message: Task completed
service: worker
time: 250
timestamp: __TIMESTAMP__

3. Filtered ERROR level events:
level: ERROR
message: Database timeout
service: api
time: 5000
timestamp: __TIMESTAMP__

level: ERROR
message: Authentication failed
service: auth
time: 15
timestamp: __TIMESTAMP__

level: ERROR
message: Connection refused
service: api
time: 3000
timestamp: __TIMESTAMP__

4. API Errors (multi-stage filter):
level: ERROR
message: Database timeout
service: api
time: 5000
timestamp: __TIMESTAMP__

level: ERROR
message: Connection refused
service: api
time: 3000
timestamp: __TIMESTAMP__

5. Error count:
3
6. Total API response time:
8139.00
7. Average API response time:
1627.80

8. API response time range (aggregation fusion - single pass):
Min:
5.00
Max:
5000.00

9. Slow requests (>1000ms):
level: ERROR
message: Database timeout
service: api
time: 5000
timestamp: __TIMESTAMP__

level: ERROR
message: Connection refused
service: api
time: 3000
timestamp: __TIMESTAMP__

=== Streaming Demo Complete ===

Key streaming benefits demonstrated:
- JSONL format: each line is independently parseable
- Multi-stage filtering: pipeline processes incrementally
- Reduce operations: O(1) memory with streaming accumulators
- Aggregation fusion: multiple reduces on same source = single pass

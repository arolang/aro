[Application-Start]
[Application-Start] --- List Operations ---
[Application-Start] List A: [2, 3, 5]
[Application-Start] List B: [1, 2, 3, 4]
[Application-Start]
[Application-Start] Intersection (A and B):
[Application-Start] [2, 3]
[Application-Start] Difference (A - B):
[Application-Start] [5]
[Application-Start] Difference (B - A):
[Application-Start] [1, 4]
[Application-Start] Union (A or B):
[Application-Start] [2, 3, 5, 1, 4]
[Application-Start]
[Application-Start] --- Multiset (Duplicate Handling) ---
[Application-Start] Multi A: [1, 2, 2, 3]
[Application-Start] Multi B: [2, 2, 2, 4]
[Application-Start]
[Application-Start] Intersection: [2, 2] (min count)
[Application-Start] [2, 2]
[Application-Start] Difference A-B: [1, 3]
[Application-Start] [1, 3]
[Application-Start]
[Application-Start] --- String Operations ---
[Application-Start] String A: hello
[Application-Start] String B: bello
[Application-Start]
[Application-Start] Intersection:
[Application-Start] ello
[Application-Start] Difference (A - B):
[Application-Start] h
[Application-Start] Union:
[Application-Start] hellob
[Application-Start]
[Application-Start] --- Object Operations (Deep) ---
[Application-Start] Object A: { name: Alice, age: 30, address: { city: NYC, zip: 10001 } }
[Application-Start] Object B: { name: Alice, age: 31, address: { city: NYC, state: NY } }
[Application-Start]
[Application-Start] Intersection (matching fields):
[Application-Start] address: city: NYC
name: Alice
[Application-Start] Difference (fields in A not matching B):
[Application-Start] address: zip: 10001
age: 30
[Application-Start] Union (merge, A wins):
[Application-Start] address: city: NYC
zip: 10001
age: 30
name: Alice

[Application-Start] --- Filter with 'in' and 'not in' ---
[Application-Start] Items: [{id:1,v:2}, {id:2,v:3}, {id:3,v:5}, {id:4,v:7}]
[Application-Start] Exclude list: [3, 5]
[Application-Start]
[Application-Start] Items where value IN exclude-list:
[Application-Start] [id: 2
value: 3, id: 3
value: 5]
[Application-Start] Items where value NOT IN exclude-list:
[Application-Start] [id: 1
